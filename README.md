# Code snippets for technical interviews

This repo contains several code snippets for technical interviews, which are intended to initiate deep technical discussions and help with understanding of coding level of a candidate.

## Usage

Provide a candidate a code snippet that is repated to one of tasks of interest. Interviewing process includes but not limited to three types of conversations:

1. Going into details of implemetation using questions prepared in [docs](docs/). Please note that senctions in tasks are enumerated in order to ease the process of finding relevant questions.
2. Gereneral conversation on code's strengths and weaknesses. Discussion of possible solution for reimplementing it.
3. Actual live refactoring/reimplementation with the goal of meeting some formal requirements (production ready system, scalability etc.).

## Tasks

1. ðŸ“— **Quantization of a neural network**. Based on [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/static_quantization_tutorial.html).
2. ðŸ“— **Shoot in your leg** - compilation of basic mistakes that can be made when designing NN architecture (from Yandex Data School)
3. ðŸ“™ **Modified CycleGAN**. Based on [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593). Modified for the task of generation of realistic avatars from portrait photos of people.

## Legend

* ðŸ“— - easy (junior scientist)
* ðŸ“™ - medium (scientist)
* ðŸ“• - hard (senior scientist)
